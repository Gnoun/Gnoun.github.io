At first I was so ambitious I wanted to discover everything by myself – reinvent all of music, never looking at what others have achieved. I composed several, very simple melodies which I played from time to time. By the age of 10 I had a few piano lessons, but I quickly got bored with them for some reason.

Despite such beginning, I keep using FL Studio to this day and I'm rather satisfied with it. By late 2019 I was convinced that music should be a priority. After I picked up a tutorial and learned about effects plugins, motivation only increased, even though I mostly limited myself to the reverb. In 2020 I started composing my first soundtracks, first for my own failed project and then for a canceled game project by my game development team, Bitrium. I also became more ambitious with piano, picking up "},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Maple Leaf Rag"}]},{type:a,value:" which taught me a lot of movement and octaves.
