In spring, I assembled plenty of musical resources necessary for composing better music. I also spent a great amount of time working on my language and piano abilities, the former of which I've made use of in July, when I started working on 4.0. Around the same time, I finally started writing a successful story, which was the main reason the update took so long. In September I started working on improving my music and decided to include that in the update, too. Earlier, I also attempted to make a return to math, but it was only possible by the time I got into the new university. My programming skills have not been in use in 2022, however I will have a return to programming in spring when I will be introduced to Python at the university.
