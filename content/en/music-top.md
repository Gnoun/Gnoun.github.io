# My Musical Compositions

Here's all the music I made in 2019-2020 and 2022. Music from 2021 isn't here because all of it belongs to a soundtrack which I plan to release later. Sorry.

**The music is free to use in non-commercial projects as long as I get visibly credited** in the place it is used in. In case it's not possible, contact me for further details. In case of commercial projects, the price is debatable (but fairly low).

Also, please don't judge the names. Sometimes I don't have good ideas with them.
