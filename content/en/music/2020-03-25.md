I started this track in mid January 2020. It's a bit weird; the main sound is called a "clav" in FL Studio. I've used the sound a few times in previous compositions, but this time it plays on low octaves and it's reverbed (but I think the decay is a little too long). The percussion isn't as good, unfortunately, as I didn't have much experience with it back then, especially when it comes to eccentric music. The piece consists of three melodies, the first one starts at 0:45. It used to be one of my personal favorites among my pieces and it still is one I really enjoy. The original piece from January included different percussion which also were playing on low octaves, but they sounded too bad and I changed them.
