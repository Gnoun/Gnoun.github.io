A calm yet very distinctive piece right from the beginning. It constantly goes on harmonic travels, visiting the major scale in 0:47, moving over great dissonances past 1:22, seventh chords following 1:44, and then even hanging out a bit with the theme from "A Faceoff with the Past"! Despite my ambitions to finally compose something beyond the fifth minute, or even pass the sixth, my initial ending idea turned out to be a complete failure and I had to limit myself to something rather unsatisfying.
