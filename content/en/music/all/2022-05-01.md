<!-- On 30 November 2021, I had a brief idea to try making my own "elevator music" for fun, and it gave birth to this piece. The repetitive rhythm, made on purpose as it was a piece for fun, ended up providing the whole character and coolness to this piece. Having trouble expanding it in the end, I quite accidentally came up with a crazy idea to add some orchestral instruments, which ended up bringing this piece on an entire new level of coolness. Already before its completion, I set it as my ringtone and keep it to this day. -->
