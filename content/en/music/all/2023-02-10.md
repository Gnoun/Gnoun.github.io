An absolutely crazy boss battle theme with the first melody derived from "Gnurak Skulur". The piece gets especially good at 0:29 (thanks to a seventh chord) but starts getting repetitive later and I think after the dynamics drop at 1:28 it gets rather uninteresting. (Also who doesn't like the random note spam at 0:56?)
