Because taiga shared the characteristics of a tundra and the forest, I decided to do exactly that with my music. Although the piece starts with the Forest melody played by the Tundra sound, it quickly evolves into its own fascinating melodies. I made a great use of the cello as a percussive element to add up to the atmosphere. One of the best moments is when the piece gets suddenly joined by the mandolin, but I'm afraid it might have ended up a bit too harsh at times again.
