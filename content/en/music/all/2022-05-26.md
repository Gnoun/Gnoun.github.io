This piece had one of the funniest beginnings. The day before retrying a failed exam from a subject I was sick of in my first university which turned out to be absolutely terrible, I was trying to forget about it trying some new music, and I found the initial sound to be a perfect representation of how tired and fed up I felt. The name was derived exactly from that exam which I'd normally already have behind, but ended up amplifying itself to the whole university. Later I struggled for a prolonged time to complete the piece. The ending, already inspired by different circumstances, is something I find one of my most beautiful passages.
