The thirteenth piece for the then not yet canceled Bitrium game project. Similar to the other "snowy" pieces, it features the electric piano and fragments of the "Frozen Ravage" motif, but this time with a more march-like melody, also invented on the piano. The piece becomes especially expressive at 2:26 and continues till the end (I especially like the piano ending), but I'm afraid the buildup to that moment is rather dull and unsatisfying.
