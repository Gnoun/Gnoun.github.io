<!-- A work I began in 2022, improvised over 2 minutes on one day and then left unfinished for over a year. In the end, because it's decently good, I decided to find my way to its end and include it here. Even so, I'm afraid the guitar doesn't fit well especially at the beginning, but couldn't find any substitute for it. -->
