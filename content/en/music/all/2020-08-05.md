One of my best pieces made in 2020. In the abandoned game project (see below), it was supposed to play in the trailer and credits. In this piece, everything cooperates perfectly. I've made most of the piece back in 14th June and it was destined to be the world map theme for the abandoned labyrinth game project (see Escape of the Bits). I've then remade the piece by replacing most of the oscillator sounds with Rhodes piano and added an ending.
