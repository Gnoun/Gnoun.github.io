The first theme I wrote for the new Bitrium survival game, provisionally named MPD. It is based on another theme called "Murmurs" (which was to serve as the title theme for the game) – the scale is the same and the melody starts very similarly. After some evolution, at 1:14 the melody is joined by a mandolin – an instrument I'd never used before. Because of its great influence on the piece, it made its appearance in almost every next piece devoted to the game. Nonetheless, even with the mandolin, I think this piece eventually gets too repetitive in the end.
