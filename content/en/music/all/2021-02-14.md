<!-- The second theme for Bitrium's canceled survival game, this time for a pyramid. I came up with the theme in January after accidentally discovering the [Double Harmonic Major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_harmonic_scale) scale. Initially it was played by a piano, it was terrible and it seemed that nothing's going to help. But after I started experiencing with my old piano as a MIDI keyboard and accidentally played the theme on a reverbed choir, the melody suddenly felt almost divine. I still used the piano as a secondary instrument and put much work into fitting the drums to it. Even though I was running out of ideas by the end, I still find this piece quite amazing. -->
