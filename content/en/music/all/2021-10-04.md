After a prolonged period of no inspiration, I finally came up with this melody, replacing different failed melodies for the piece. Perhaps I'd do the same with this one, quite dissatisfied with the oboe part, but what followed was too deep and expressive to be left unheard. Also, the moment at 3:01 was totally not inspired by C418's "Strad".
