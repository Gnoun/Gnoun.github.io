My first and so far only piece composed fully in the melodic minor scale. Although the same motif repeats throughout most of the piece, the variation it receives, as well as the atmospheric deep piano, followed by a dreamy transformation to the piano section starting at 1:57, makes it an absolutely distinctive piece among my works. It also has a funny name history â€“ at first it was intended for an "Aquatic Forest" biome (the leading sound was different), so I called it "Grove of the Mystics". After changing the main sound I had no idea what to do with the name. Then, at one moment, I accidentally wrote it with double "o", getting "Groove". It was so funny that I couldn't not keep it.
