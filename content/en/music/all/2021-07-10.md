After more experiments with the Double Harmonic Major scale in spring, I came up with an amazing melody, which I gave to the flute and mandolin duo at 0:58 which became the base for this piece. After a short electric piano improvisation, the melody returns with double power, after which it proceeds to a rhythmic repetition by the electric piano. Even though it sounds amazing, I struggled a lot with the beginning, and I'm also afraid the percussive mandolin may be hard to bear for a longer time.
