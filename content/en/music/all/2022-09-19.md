The first piece intended for an ultimately canceled dungeon game called Gon Guon. I started it 5 months earlier and had trouble expanding it, which can be heard by the awkwardness of 0:50, but it was one of those pieces that are too cool to be left unfinished, and eventually ended up great, though perhaps too repetitive at times. I really like how the organ moves down an octave by the end. I still fear the piece has too much reverb despite trying my best to get the perfect result.
