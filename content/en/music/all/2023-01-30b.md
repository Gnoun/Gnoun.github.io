<!-- Don't get discouraged by the initial repetitiveness, and you'll see that this piece has some actual melodies to it. While they are written in a minor scale, I constantly interrupt them with the less consonant initial theme which adds a lot of variation. I especially like the harmonics in 2:16. It's worth mentioning that what makes this piece unusual is that it both begins and ends with a diminished chord. -->
