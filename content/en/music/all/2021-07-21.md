<!-- One of my best and also most ambient pieces. After coming up with the initial melody on the piano, I followed by mixing it with a melody from an unfinished piece for a biome called "the Gloom". After 2:16, when the piece stops for a while to focus on a single melody, it begins to peacefully transform back into the main theme and I find it the best moment in the piece. -->
