<!-- A very slow and soothing piece representing a tundra. Because of its snowy character, I used the old theme from "Frozen Ravage", played by the same sound, and mixed it with the leading theme I came up with on the piano, but because they were hard to connect, the theme only comes in at 1:43, almost halfway through the piece. After that, I came up with a mandolin extension of the theme, but perhaps it ended up too harsh. -->
