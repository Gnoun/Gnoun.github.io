<!-- Based on a percussive theme I invented while tapping a book, which I initially meant for a "jungle" theme that was never created, this mandolin piece evolves into something much deeper which I already find comparable with the first pieces in the soundtrack. Anyway, maybe it wasn't the best idea to use a contrabass as percussion again. -->
