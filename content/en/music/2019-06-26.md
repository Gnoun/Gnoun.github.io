One of the two pieces I've created with my brother [BeetMacol](https://beetmacol.com). He made the percussion loop and I added the piano. The music keeps building up the whole time and then it ends, I think a little too fast. I may improve it sometime, but the original project file was lost, so I'd have to re-create the entire piece.
