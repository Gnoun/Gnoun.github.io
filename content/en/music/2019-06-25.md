A very positive march-like music I originally came up with back in November 2018 while playing the piano. At first I wanted the whole piece to be played by guitars or something alike, but I couldn't find any and I didn't know what a VSTi is at the time. In fact, the biggest problem with this music is my lack of experience with working with sounds themselves, so I consider this one quite a success.
