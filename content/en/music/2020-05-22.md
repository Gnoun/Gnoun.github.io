This one is different from most of my music. It's a bit reflective and it lasts almost 5 minutes. You may find it very repetitive but it eventually evolves into something more. The main sound is... electric piano; somehow I managed to apply such effects that it sounds a bit... cold, and thus the "Frozen" in the name. Anytime the music gets more interesting, it is joined by a string instrument which serves as a great background. The rest is just reverbed and inversed percussion. Strange, huh?
