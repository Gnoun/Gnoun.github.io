The first music I made for a boss battle, but the game project it was made for was abandoned as I mentioned below. I didn't have time to make music in fall 2020 because of huge amounts of schoolwork; this piece was started in October 2020. After I found out about equalization and started learning music theory (hmm, about time), I've made this track one of my best compositions compared to the previous ones. Unfortunately I wasn't experienced enough with equalization and I kept the percussion quiet throughout the piece in order not to distract the listener from the main melody; apart from that, the music is really cool. You won't believe it, but I came up with the beginning while learning to play Rondo Alla Turca on piano. My favorite moments in the music are 0:53-1:13 and the last 15 seconds.
