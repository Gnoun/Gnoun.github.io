This is the first completed piece I have ever created in FL Studio. I named it "Inspiration" because I had a huge spark of inspiration at the time and I made the whole music in just 1,5 hours. I know it doesn't sound that well, it's quite monotonous and the percussion I chose was just the basic one provided in the most basic FL Studio template, but at the time it was something great for me as I've never had such an experience before. After all, everything needs to start somewhere. This is where I have started.
