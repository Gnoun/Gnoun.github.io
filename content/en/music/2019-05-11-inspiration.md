In late June 2019 I had a lot of motivation and started creating many pieces, sometimes a few at the same time. This one is a piano solo composition. The name comes from the fact that most of the notes used in the music formed something which looked like a tunnel to me. This music is messy at times (for example, 1:07-1:10 is quite confusing) and some sounds have doubled volume because I accidentally placed them twice and it wasn't visible that there are two notes in the same place. Nevertheless, this music also features some nice melodies; my favorite part is 0:33-0:39.
