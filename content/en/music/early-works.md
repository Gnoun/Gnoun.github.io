This album comprises most of my early compositions made in 2019-2020. It doesn't include some of my earliest compositions which can be found in the [chronological list](../music).

It can be divided into several sub-albums:
1. **2019** – works from that year initially hadn't included any effects plugins as I discovered them by the end of the year (currently they are mixed and mastered);
2. **The Battle of Azgravan** – may be considered a single within an album, as it was initially meant to be part of an album that was never created;
3. **Short improvisations** – the four (out of ten) March 2020 improvisations;
4. **Spring Piano** – piano solos from spring 2020, i.e. *Windy Dream*, *Clown's Teeth*, *Monotonous Moments* (not included) and *May it Shine*;
5. **Labyrinth Land** – two (or three, if *the Spirit of Adventure* is included) compositions I wrote for a canceled solo game project with given name;
6. **Absolutely Extreme Misfortune (AEM)** – the last five tracks composed for a canceled dungeon platform game project by Bitrium.

Several pieces don't fit in any of the given sub-albums and are loosely incorporated in the album.
