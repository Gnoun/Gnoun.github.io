I used to have problems whenever I didn't have inspiration for more than even just a week, and this piece is kind of a reflection on this. Once again it's a piano-strings composition, but this time I've came up with most of the melody on piano. The only problem I have with this piece is that the piano doesn't really fit the strings. Nevertheless, the ending is quite impressive.
