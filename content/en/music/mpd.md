This is half of a soundtrack I intended to create for a canceled ambitious survival game project by Bitrium. Initially the pieces had no actual names and were simply called "Forest", "Pyramid", "Tundra", etc. and may be referred to as such. Because the soundtrack was written before the game's production, which was ultimately canceled, many tracks would possibly not fit in-game. Instead, they ended up being a great challenge which enriched my music experience.
