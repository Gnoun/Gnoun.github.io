### I started making music in late March, 2019.

At first it wasn't a serious activity and I worked on a project once in a week, two weeks, or maybe even a month at first. By late April I started to make it more often and soon I started creating my first pieces. The projects I worked on earlier weren't serious at all and were mostly experiments as I was checking out how the program (FL Studio) works.
