After over 2 weeks of lack of inspiration caused mainly with the failed labyrinth game project (see below for more), I've managed to create this music and it's once again one of reflective character, once again features piano and strings, and once again gets a little more positive over time. This one also features percussion, but it isn't really fitting the entire piece. The name refers to the lack of time to do everything we want to do and decisions we have to make about abandoning some projects for succeeding in different ones.
