# Welcome to Gnoun's website!

Nice to see you here! On this website, everything is made from scratch by [Gnoun](#about-gnoun). If you want to be up to date, make sure to visit the [What's up](/sup) section. If you want to read the website in another language, select one from the **Language selection** on the right. You can also check the links on the left; apart from my YouTube channel and Discord server, they include some of my friends' websites. Enjoy your stay!

## What is this website about?

### [Music!](music)

<div class="flex flex-row space-x-1 gap-5">

<MdImage img="titles/music.png" width=300 height=300></MdImage>

<div>

I started composing in 2019 without any professional experience. Although I've **never gone through a music course** and have to work through everything myself, I'm **gradually getting better**. In the following years I've learnt equalizing and mastering to a decent extent and now I'm beginning to experience with sounds at the deepest level. I had my first serious encounter with **music theory** in 2020 and in 2023 I read an entire textbook on advanced music theory. Most of my compositions were inspired by failed or canceled projects of my game development team called Bitrium.

### [Math!](math) (but cool)

<div class="flex flex-row space-x-1 gap-5">

<div>

In 2019-2020 I created several [animated graphs](math/graphs) created solely from all sorts of math equations! Although I'm not doing it anymore, perhaps they're worth a look.

I also created a set of **[math tools](math/tools)** which are **comfortable and easy in use**. Here you'll find a fraction simplifier, unit and equation form converters, analytic geometry tools, and even complex numbers. I've also put in the work to explain how each of these works and what formulas I'm using.

### [Self-improvement](other/tbp)

<div class="flex flex-row space-x-1 gap-5">

<MdImage img="titles/self-improvement.png" width=300 height=300></MdImage>

<div>

Are you dissatisfied after **seeking improvement and never feeling fulfilled?** Consider a brief visit to my self-improvement research notes. I've tried my best to put together a lot of information into a concise framework to prevent descending into rabbit holes which often end up unsatisfying and unproductive.

The notes here should help improve time management, health, creativity, motivation, confidence, discipline, communication, organization and effectiveness. If you still end up unsatisfied, feel free to give feedback or even help me improve the project.

### [Writing](other/writing)

<div class="flex flex-row space-x-1 gap-5">

Another quickly growing part of my website is devoted to writing. **So far, unfortunately, I'm writing only in Polish**, but I hope my growing language skills will soon allow me to make my writing more accessible.

## How was this website created?

The website is made with an advanced framework called **Nuxt.js** and hosted using **GitHub Pags**. Initially I wrote it in HTML, but my brother [BeetMacol](https://beetmacol.com) rewrote it because he couldn't withstand it. Currently I'm already getting around in the code and I add most of the content myself with much less help.

The website's design is my own original idea.

## Who is Gnoun?

There's an [entire section](other/about) on this, but in short, I'm an individualist with a great appreciation of music, especially electronic and classical. I'm also a decent math enthusiast, so I may be called a "mathemusician", but that's not everything. Since youth I've also been a great language enthusiast which I hope is quite visible by the amount of languages I'm translating this website to, so far all by myself. My interest in designing things got me into programming and recently I created an entire organization system in Python (though with decent help of [BeetMacol](https://beetmacol.com), again). Although I'm highly analytical, I'm not giving up with creative activities, the best example being the music, but I also do [writing](other/stories) (though so far untranslated, in Polish), [worldbuilding](other/livuluria) (though so far I don't know what to do with it), a constructed language (same issue), a board game, a Minecraft map, and a little bit of drawing. I complement my creativity with research on various subjects, and since I've really got into self-improvement over the years, I try to look up almost everything nowadays, with my only limit being time.
