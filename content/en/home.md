## About Gnoun

I'm an electronic music composer and math enthusiast, or "mathemusician" in short. I've learned to play the piano all by myself and I continuously improve my skills. I've also self-learned music theory and a large part of [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus). The [DAW](https:/Questions/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation) I use is [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/) and I create my data graphs in [Desmos Graphing Calculator](https://desmos.com/calculator).

Besides math and music, I'm a language enthusiast. While having English mastered and Polish as my native language, I'm also learning Spanish and Russian on the Internet. Moreover, I'm occasionally working on my own [conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) named Daikova. Apart from languages, I've recently started to improve my writing skills and I'm working on a few stories, but only in Polish for now. I once used to learn programming as well and used to be a bit fine with the C++ programming language], but lack of ideas and miserable failures along with the lack of time caused me to limit my programming skills to making this website only.
