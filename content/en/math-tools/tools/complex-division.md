Complex division is more difficult than addition, subtraction or multiplication (hence I made this tool). To divide two complex numbers in rectangular form, you need to multiply the number in the denominator by its [complex conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate). To keep the same value, you also need to multiply the numerator. After a bit of simplyfing, you get the result.
