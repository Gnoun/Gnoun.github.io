To convert a complex number from rectangular form to polar form, we need to find the magnitude and angle of the complex number. To find the magnitude, apply the Pythagorean theorem (for complex number z = a + bi and magnitude r, r<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>). To find the angle, apply the tangent function (tan Î¸ = b/a).
