- If you encounter the expression "NaN", it is the abbreviation for "Not a Number"; in most cases, this means you haven't filled all the necessary boxes. Otherwise, it means your result indeed isn't a number.
- Sometimes javascript fails to precisely approximate decimal expansions in the results, so it is recommended to trust up to 8-10 digits after the decimal point. If you know a solution to this, please contact me.
