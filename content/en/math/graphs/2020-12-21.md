So far this is one of my largest projects. Here, multiple flowers made of trigonometric equations appear on the plane. I've embedded the YouTube video instead of the Desmos project itself because the presentation is really long and this way you can move or stop at any moment in the video. You can access the project itself [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/v2fqg8i0kf).
