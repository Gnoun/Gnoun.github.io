Here's the first project I've made after discovering that you can create conditions telling for what intervals can something be displayed in Desmos. With parameters in the intervals. I've also used the Taylor expansion of -sin(|x|). (By the way, this inequality below is supposed to be some kind of outfit for that head; this is certainly not vomit.)
