### [Desmos Graphing Calculator](https://desmos.com/calculator)

Desmos is a great graphing site which offers graphing functions, equations, inequalities, plotting tables of data, evaluating equations, exploring changes with parameters and more. You can sign up to save and share your graphs. I've been using it for many years and you can see my creations in the [Graphs](/graphs) section.

### [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/)

WolframAlpha is a unique engine for computing answers and providing knowledge, not only about mathematics. Among others, it can solve any equation or plot any function.

If you know any other great math tools, you can tell me about them and I'll consider linking them here.
