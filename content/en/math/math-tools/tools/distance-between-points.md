To find the distance between two points, we first have to find the distance between the X coordinates (dx) and Y coordinates (dy) of the points. After that, we apply the Pythagorean theorem (dx and dy are the legs of a right triangle, and the distance between A and B is the hypotenuse) and evaluate the square root of the sum of dx squared and dy squared.
