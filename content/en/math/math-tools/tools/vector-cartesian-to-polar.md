To convert Cartesian coordinates to [polar coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system), we need to separately evaluate the radius *r* and the angle *θ*. The radius is the same as the vector's length, so we just apply the [vector length](magnitude) formula to get it. To get *θ*, we look for the angle whose tangent equals *y* over *x*.

*Side note: You may also use this as a point converter.*
