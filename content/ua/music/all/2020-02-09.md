This music was supposed to play in the title screen of an unfinished game project called The Battle of Azgravan. Unfortunately, the audio is clipping a bit throughout most of the music. Luckily, the second half is a bit more listenable. As you can see, I was a little crazy at 2:27, but it eventually transforms into a quite cool melody at 2:40 and ends quite nicely. I might improve this piece sometime because the melody is great; perpaphs I'll make an orchestrated version.
