In early July me and my friends from our game development team decided to work on a future project and I started composing music for it. Eventually the project was canceled and I composed 5 tracks in the meantime; this is the first one. It's a really nice composition featuring many string instruments as well as a bass sound for the first time, but I'm not really proud of the ending.
