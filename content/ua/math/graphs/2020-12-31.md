As the year was ending, I've decided to create multiple fireworks from math equations. It was really difficult, but after several hours I've achieved my goal. The fireworks are made of linear, trigonometric and circle equations. I've added some audio to make it more realistic and spectacular and made a YouTube video out of it.
