## Danaikor ("Oasis")

Danaikor (Daikova for "Oasis") is a Minecraft adventure mode map I built in 2022-2023. It consists of several independent modes based mainly around parkour and combat.

The main purpose I built this map for was building training, but that doesn't mean one can't find it enjoyable, which I hope happens.

### The Devilish Parkour

<br />

A regular stage-by-stage parkour divided into several larger areas. Although the parkour gets progressively harder, it is generally rather hard from the beginning and the difficulty doesn't rise dramatically. Each stage ends with a checkpoint, so one can leave it at any time with progress saved. If you are observant, you may also notice that each area has its own secret stage.

### The Nether Island

<br />

"Inside" this upside down combat-oriented island, you will find four combat sets and three different gamemodes. The first is regular PvP on four selectable arenas; the "Nether Front" is a last stand PvE arena shaped like a downwards-facing trench, while the "Nether Tunnel" is a very long tunnel combining parkour with PvE combat.

### The Burrowers' Shaft

<br />

There is a purpose for this horizontal shaft's entrance to be marked with a "do not enter" sign. Once entered, you are guaranteed to find traps, mysterious mechanisms and dangerous parkours, alongside occasional monsters. The treasures, however, may be found satisfying.

### The Fort

<br />

The Fort is a massive complex comprising a large variety of chambers, passages and tunnels. It generally shares the characteristics of the Burrowers' Shaft (in fact, the two are even connected) except that everything is less obvious and clear. It's hard to enter and easy to get lost in the countless chambers, but the rewards – not only treasure chests – may be surprising. If you seek well, you may find that the Fort offers a challenge similar to one in the Nether Island, but far greater and more elaborate.
