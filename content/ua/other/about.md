I really like writing about myself so get ready for some boredom

In this section I briefly explain who I am and the purpose and origin of what I do.

[can include section on why I like writng about myself, awareness, and so on] [the truth is I don't do it that often, the only place I really write about myself in is my diary I write every few months]

## My adventure with music

I was never indifferent with music and had contact with it since my earliest years. Since I was few years old, I had a piano at home – first a children one with 5 octaves and 100 sounds, then another digital but with normal size and sound. At first I was so ambitious I wanted to discover everything by myself – reinvent all of music, never looking at what others have achieved. I composed several, very simple melodies which I played from time to time. By the age of 10 I had a few piano lessons, but I quickly got bored with them for some reason. I still played piano from time to time but never explored and did less and less.

At the end of 2017, I was seriously dissatisfied with myself regarding essentially everything and decided a change is needed. I made a 15-point to-do list, with one of the points being about piano. Nothing specific, just "learn more". By that time I was aware, though, that I can only get better on the inside by learning from the outside. At the time I had little awareness of music and picked up two pieces from my then favorite game *Luigi's Mansion 2* and learned them successfully one after another. Throughout 2018, my awareness increased significantly thanks to YouTube channels such as *Vinheteiro* or *Sheet Music Boss* while I challenged myself with harder pieces, still from games and movies, and without having a well-developed routine. By the end of the year I also began coming up with my own pieces.

2019 was the year which set the path. I had my first classical piece learned (*Moonlight Sonata Mvt. 1*), and also my brother [BeetMacol](https://beetmacol.com) showed me FL Studio and said it's a program I can compose in. Because I was still unexplorative, I didn't even bother checking out other options. After a few months of occasional experiences with the demo, I bought the DAW in June and started composing for real. Despite such beginning, I keep using FL Studio to this day and I'm rather satisfied with it. By late 2019 I was convinced that music should be a priority. After I picked up a tutorial and learned about effects plugins, motivation only increased, even though I mostly limited myself to the reverb. In 2020 I started composing my first soundtracks, first for my own failed project and then for a canceled game project by my game development team, Bitrium. I also became more ambitious with piano, picking up *Maple Leaf Rag* which taught me a lot of movement and octaves. By the end of the year I forced myself into some music theory and also learned equalizing which made my music a lot better.

In 2021 I began working on a new soundtrack for Bitrium, this time a lot better than my previous compositions thanks to what I learned. I also discovered the Double Harmonic Major scale and quickly became addicted to it. By the middle of the year I also started getting serious about piano, started using the pedal (yep, about time), established an actual routine, and became absolutely immersed with arpeggios thanks to *Clair de Lune*. Then I also got absolutely immersed with Rachmaninoff's *Prelude in G Minor*. Because of their advancement, I believe these piano pieces had a deep impact on my further compositions. By late 2022, because I was learning too much at once, I decided to get into actual practice exercises (about time, again). I also began reworking all of my music compositions so far in anticipation of their future release, which I completed in 2023.

Currently, I'm still immersed with a lot of music but hold my back and put in a lot of practice in both learning and creating music. I'm starting to have a grip on music theory and use it in the most appropriate way, that is by constantly attempting to break the patterns. Despite all these years I still have a lot to discover and experience.

## Why I write



## "programming, designing levels, board games, and all that stuff"

I once used to learn programming as well and used to be a bit fine with the C++ programming language, but lack of ideas and miserable failures along with the lack of time caused me to limit my programming skills to making this website only.
