## The Livuluria universe

This page is going to be frequently updated as the world is created. Currently, the page is mostly incomplete.

### Omakea

The main (most developed) continent in Livuluria is called Omakea.

### Lore

The lore is still in preparation and will be exposed later.

### External information

The map above may still be polished, as some of it may lack detail and/or geological sense, but the general look should be preserved.

#### Creation process

I spent approximately 144 hours working on this map. It was created by hand with all significant ranges mapped on a separate layer, presented below.

If you ever thought of creating a similar map, make sure you are aware of its scale so that you won't make a mistake like me and spend an entire month trying to finish this thing.

#### Inspirations

When thinking of the general image of the map, I was inspired by a flipped map of Europe combined with a map of a world in Minecraft.

During the creation, I mostly found inspiration in several selected images, most of which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fnRYNkDJXyqwuk_lhl0AE_i5_P7zwMoQ/view?usp=sharing).

### Possible future updates on Livuluria

When it comes to continents, I'm not planning to make any in the near future due to the amount of time it took to create the map of Omakea. However, future maps may include Premoria and Banotusi. A map of the whole planet may also appear someday.

When it comes to Omakea itself, apart from detailed maps of regions I may also create historical/political maps, climate maps, language maps, and war map animations. All of these, however, require a big and consolidated lore, which is currently not a thing.
