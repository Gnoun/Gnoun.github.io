# TBP: My self-improvement research notes

Here's a compilation of most of my research regarding self-improvement. The purpose of this project is to replace lengthy articles with succinct and exhaustive information while retaining it in a clear, stable framework. Click [here](#tbp) or scroll down to learn more.

<!-- I might've given away too much info on conquering the world, so be careful. -->

**Disclaimer**: This research is by no means exhaustive. As of today, this research relies solely on two books and only several government websites. Other sources, though largely credible and conscientously selected, may possibly be improved.

This framework will be constantly updated and refined to eliminate its weaknesses.
