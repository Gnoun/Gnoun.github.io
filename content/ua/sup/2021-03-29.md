I haven't had much time recently because I'm preparing for matura exams, but today I've finished the Music section where you can listen to most of the music I have made. I also think of expanding this section a little by writing a bit more than one to two short sentences per entry. Well then, recently my perception of mathematics has changed quite a bit and I started focusing on graphing certain data instead of random equations. I've created a "template" timeline on Desmos so that I can graph tables with data on it. You can access the template [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/6pphgr9wn5). When I create a project of this kind worth sharing, I'll upload it in the Graphs section.
